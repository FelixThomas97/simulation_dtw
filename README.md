# Planning and Simulation of Robot Movements and comparison with DTW Algorithm

Simple pre-set trajectories implemented to realise the comparison between theorethical and pratical movements in a robot.

The code is already implemented as an example for the ABB IRB 1200 and the accessory folders needed to run the repository are already inside the source folder. Make sure as new robots are added to follow the same logic, including the respective folders and files (MoveIt, Gazebo and Support Files from the Manufacturer)
